This is a repo containing all the information you need to build a 4-channel audio controller using a PT-2313l ic from its bare bones ,
The code help the user to interface with the ic using a 16x2 display 2 switches for input control and mute function with a rotrary encoder to toggle between menu 1 containing bass,treble,volume control and menu 2 contains loudness ,gain ,attenuation of 4 speakers.
Using the data sheet from princeton (the manufacturer of PT-2313 ic) i have written the code in arduino to call specific address to which the ic responds .
This code uses a standalone atmega328p ic as the mcu for the processor.
All the circuit diagram is provided in this repo hope it helps!!!
THANK YOU!!
